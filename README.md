Problem Statement:
	
	One of the great controversies of the modern game of cricket is the determination of whether a bowler is using an illegal throw-like bowling action. Current regulations of the International Cricket Council (ICC) set the legal limit of 15 degrees of permissible straightening of the elbow joint for all bowlers in international cricket. This law applies between the point at which the bowling arm passes above shoulder height and the point at which the ball is released. Changes to the rules of cricket have reduced some of the confusion, yet, because of the complexities of the biomechanics of the arm it is difficult for an umpire to make a judgment on this issue. 

Existing Technologies:

	Expensive laboratory based testing has been able to quantify the action of a bowler and this testing is routinely used by cricket authorities to assess a bowling action. Detractors of the method suggest that it is unable to replicate match conditions, has long lead times for assessment and is only available to the elite.
	 
Solution:

	We present a technology and method for an in- game assessment using a wearable arm sensor for differentiating between a legal bowling action and throwing. The method uses inertial sensors on the upper and lower arm with Intel Edison that identifies the multiple data patterns, with these data patterns we updating these data to cloud database in which it helps identify the bowling action. By identifying Suspect deliveries, as assessed by an expert biomechanist using high speed video and motion capture reveal valid distinctive inertial signatures. The technology is an important step in the monitoring of bowling action on-field in near real-time. The technology is suitable for use in competition as well as a training tool for developing athletes.
